# README

This is a portfolio of Zoe, deployed with the url https://zoe-cui.herokuapp.com/.

This web app was built from scratch using ruby on rails. I am able to use css and html to structure the website, use a database and form to request and store data and use tests to ensure the correctness of the application. Moreover, the functionalities of the site are tailored to my user group who are the viewers of my portfolio.
